# VERMIN SOULS - VIDEO ART PROJECT
Video art based on our darkest desires and vices. Shadowself exposed. The feeling that the little person inside me is shattered into pieces. Darkest self is usually hard to piece together. Fueled by emotion, passion and despair.

Slow zoom out shot of hair floating in a glass water container, creating ripples. Lit up from below with green. 

Zoom out reveals a naked girl floating on water. 

She suddenly opens her eyes (closeup).

She curls and stands up in the water and leaves the container.

Then she stands motionless in an empty dark room. Light reflecting of her wet face. Drips slowly coming down on a dusty floor.

Something fills the air in the dark warehouse room - an entity. Girl seems to be unaffected by its presence. Completely calm. Accepting.

'Inject' she whispers.

Glitch title: PHASE A: INITIATED.

She drops to the floor, dust comes up.

7 people wearing black clothes and masks enter the room and surround the body.

Wide shot, they start to tighten the circle.
Top shot, they continue to tighten the circle. Raising muffled sound.
Cut away to closeup so we don't see the whole room.
Wide shot, blacked people are suddenly rats that start wandering around the warehouse room.

Title: PHASE B: INITIATED
